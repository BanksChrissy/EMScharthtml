# EMS Charting App (Static HTML)

## ✅ How to Host on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repo (e.g., `ems-charting-html`)
2. Upload these files (not in a folder — at the root level)
3. Go to Settings → Pages
4. Set Source: `Deploy from a branch` → `main` → `/ (root)`
5. Wait 1–2 minutes, and your app will be live at:
   https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/
